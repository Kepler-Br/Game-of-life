# Conway's Game of life
Institute course work done with SDL2 and OpenGL core profile.  
By default application starts in 800X600 resolution. You can change this in main.cpp file.  
Field size can be changed in stateplaying.h by changing `worldXSize` and `worldYSize`.  
Required libraries: `SDL2, GLEW, GLM`.  

Controls:  
* `WASD` for movement;  
* `QE` for camera zoom in/out;  
* Mouse left button for placing cells;  
* Mouse right button for removing cells.  

A bit buggy and poor coded, so don't expect much of it.
